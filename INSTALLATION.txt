This is a quick guide to installing Ginger.

1. Install the GNU development toolchain
----------------------------------------

Specifically, you will need gcc, make, uname and ar.  On Mac OS X 
these are available once Xcode is installed.  On Windows you must 
install either cygwin or msys.

2. Install prerequisite libraries
---------------------------------

Install the libs and headers for each library as appropriate for 
your OS and development platform.  Ginger has been tested with
Cairo 1.8.8 and Pango 1.25.3.  Some older versions of these
libraries are known not to work.  If you need to compile these
from source, do something like this:

export ABI=32
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install

3. Build and install Ginger
---------------------------

Ginger uses a very minimal configure script you should execute by
typing:

$ ./configure

You can further set many of the installation defaults by editing
Makefile.defaults.  And once configured, you can build libginger and ginc 
by typing:

$ make

And finally you can install Ginger (make sure you are a priveleged user
if necessary) by typing:

$ make install

4. The Post-Install
-------------------

Ginger supports several environmental variables you can use to tweak
ginc compiles.  If these variables are not set, it will default to
sane settings from the install.

The following shows the bash syntax for setting the four available
environmental variables.

export GIN_C=g++
export GIN_LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib
export GIN_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/share/ginger
export GIN_CFLAGS="-I/sw/include -I/usr/include/cairo -I/sw/include/cairo"

You may also need to add /usr/local/bin to your path.

export PATH:$PATH:/usr/local/bin
